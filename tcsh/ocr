# -density 300 and -depth 8 control the resolution of the resulting TIFF image. OCR works best with high-resolution images; if you leave this out, you're likely to get garbled results.
echo ...finished convert to tiff $1 at `date` 
#"u -strip -background white -alpha off" removes any alpha channels, and makes the background white. Tesseract is rather picky about this kind of thing.
